          These Terms & Conditions govern your use of the VÉLORE platform.
          By accessing or using VÉLORE, you agree to be bound by these terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          VÉLORE operates as a curated discovery platform. We showcase
          products from third-party retailers and provide links that
          redirect users to those retailers’ websites.
        </p>

        <p>
          VÉLORE does not sell products directly, process payments, or
          fulfil orders. Any purchase you make is subject to the terms,
          conditions, and policies of the retailer you purchase from.
        </p>

        <p>
          Product prices, availability, shipping options, and promotions
          are determined by the retailer and may change without notice.
          VÉLORE is not responsible for inaccuracies or changes on
          third-party websites.
        </p>

        <p>
          To the fullest extent permitted by law, VÉLORE shall not be liable
          for any loss, damage, or dispute arising from purchases made
          through external retailers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We reserve the right to update these Terms & Conditions at any
          time. Continued use of VÉLORE constitutes acceptance of any
          updates.
