          Dalra operates as a curated fashion discovery platform. We do not
          hold inventory or fulfil orders directly.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you select a product on Dalra, you are redirected to the
          retailer’s website to complete your purchase. Shipping, delivery
          times, customs duties, and returns are handled entirely by the
          retailer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each retailer sets their own shipping rates, delivery timelines,
          and return policies. We recommend reviewing the retailer’s
          shipping and returns information carefully before placing an
          order.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have questions regarding an order, delivery, or return,
          please contact the retailer directly using the details provided
          on their website.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dalra does not process payments, manage deliveries, or handle
          refunds, but we are always happy to assist with general guidance
          if needed.
